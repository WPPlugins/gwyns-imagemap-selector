"There are two basic usages of this plugin. The first is if you know exactly "
"which URLs are linked to each area of the imagemap. This is appropriate for "
"menus (and very likely used on a widget) that will not change much over "
"time. This uses the \"direct\" approach and requires URLs to be explicitly "
"named on each area; thus, it's quite similar to directly placing the "
"imagemap HTML inside the post/page/widget (the only advantage of using the "
"shortcode is to get automatic ids)."

"The second variant makes a query on the WordPress database and returns the "
"appropriate permalinks for each post. You can query by category, tag, or "
"even add a free query (it will be passed to WP_Query so the same syntax "
"applies; see <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/WP_Query"
"\">http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/WP_Query</a>). The order of "
"permalinks thus retrieved will dynamically be assigned to each area (in the "
"order those are written). If there are more areas than permalinks, the "
"remaining areas will be ignored (the reverse situation is undefined). "
"Category and tag queries can be made by name or id and can be retrieved "
"either in the descending (default) or ascending order."

"Thus, imagemaps can be either in direct mode (direct=1) or in query mode "
"(omit the direct clause). When in query mode, you can use query by "

"complies with WP_Query types of queries. Queries by category or tag can be "
"made in descending (default; can be omitted) or ascending order (this "
"parameter is ignored when using a WP_Query-compliant query instead). The "
"<code>img</code> parameter is mandatory. <code>map</code>, <code>id</code>, "

"Warning: this plugin will not work with any automatic image-resizing "
"mechanisms (e.g. Jetpack's Photon or similar tools, specially those for "
"dynamic/fluid themes which resize images for mobile viewing). This is a "
"limitation of the <code>imagemap</code> HTML command, which is very simple "
"and basic, and relies upon absolute values relative to an image's "
"dimensions, which are supposed to be known in advance. There are a few "
"techniques to rewrite imagemaps (basically recalculating the selection areas "
"based on the redimensioned image), but these are a bit pointless for the "
"purpose of this plugin, which totally avoids Javascript (for browsers which "
"have it turned off), and there are already better, Javascript/Flash/Java-"
"based solutions which allow clickable areas on resized images."
